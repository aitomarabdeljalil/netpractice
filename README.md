# NetPractice

NetPractice is a system administration and networking project that focuses on the practical aspects of networking. This project contains multiple levels of network configurations represented in JSON format.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several JSON files, each representing a different level or network configuration:

- level1.json
- level2.json
- level3.json
- level4.json
- level5.json
- level6.json
- level7.json
- level8.json

Each level file contains information about network interfaces (ifs) and routes.

## Features

- IP address configuration
- Subnet mask configuration
- Routing table entries
- Default gateway configuration

## Usage

To use this project, examine each level's JSON file to understand the network configuration. You may need to use a compatible networking tool or simulator to visualize and work with these configurations.
